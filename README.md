### Hey there, I'm Haziqah.

- :earth_asia: I'm passionate about all things geospatial.
- :computer: Currently, I am working to level up my GIS programming skills. 
- :snake: My go to programming language is Python (mainly because it's the one I'm most familiar with :sweat_smile:) I know a little bit of R, and I hope to expand my skillset to include Javascript!
